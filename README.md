Welcome to the public repository for **HSR Pizza Helper**, a game tool app for Honkai: Star Rail.

**HSR Pizza Helper** is a game tool app based on Swift and SwiftUI, available on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS.

## Introduction

Similar to [Genshin-Pizza-Helper](https://github.com/CanglongCl/Genshin-Pizza-Helper), this app helps you track your stamina and expeditions on widgets. Other features are coming soon.

This app is open source, ad-free, and free of charge. We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving it.

The app is currently still in development and has not been uploaded to the app store.

## Build & Contribution

This repository uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce code style and conventions. Please install it before building.

It is also recommended to install [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat), which helps you easily format the code. If you have installed it, the build script will automatically format the code.

Before pushing your code, run `make lint` and `make format` in the terminal to automatically correct and format the code.
