This repo uses the [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce code style and conventions. Install it before build. It is also recommanded to install [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) which helps you format the codes easily (if you have installed one, it will auto format the codes via build script while building). 

Run `make lint` and `make format` in terminal before pushing your code. These two command helps auto correct and format the codes.
